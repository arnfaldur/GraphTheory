\section{Independent Sets ({\bf max 30})}

\begin{problem}
 \item (10 points) Find a recursive formula for counting the number of \emph{maximal} independent sets in $P_n$ $(n\ge 1)$. Use it to derive a formula counting the number of maximal independent sets in $C_n$. 
\end{problem}


\begin{problem}
 \item (8 points) Show that for every simple graph $G$,
\begin{subprob} \item  $\alpha(G)\ge \frac{|V(G)|}{D(G)+1}$.
\item Every \emph{maximal} independent set contains at least $\frac{|V(G)|}{\Delta(G)+1}$ vertices.
\item If $G$ is triangle-free then $\alpha(G)\ge \Delta(G)$.
\end{subprob}
\end{problem}

% Verify
\begin{solution}
  Since $\chi(G) \leq D(G) + 1$, we have: $\alpha(G) \geq \frac{|V(G)|}{\chi(G)} \geq \frac{|V(G)|}{D(G)+1}$
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}
  Every maximal independent set contains at least $\alpha(G)$ vertices by
  definition. Since $\chi(G) \leq \Delta(G) + 1$, we have: $\alpha(G) \geq \frac{|V(G)|}{\chi(G)} \geq \frac{|V(G)|}{\Delta(G)+1}$
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}
  Let $v$ be a vertex with degree $\Delta(G)$. Observe that $v$'s neighbours
  form an independent set of vertices. Thus, the maximum independent set is of
  size at least $\Delta(G)$.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
 \item (8 points) Show that:
\begin{subprob} \item  For every simple graph $G$, $\alpha(G)\le |V(G)|-\delta(G)$. 
\item If $G$ has no isolated vertices, then $\alpha(G)\le \frac{|E(G)|}{\delta(G)}$.
\end{subprob}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
 \item (15 points) Show that every simple triangle-free graph has an independent set of size at least $\lfloor\sqrt{n}\rfloor$. Find a triangle-free graph that does not have an independent set of size  $\lceil\sqrt{n}\rceil$
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  Let G be a simple triangle free graph. Let's observe the degrees of the
  vertices of G. If there exists a vertex $v$ with degree $d(v) \leq \sqrt{n}$,
  then the set of $v$'s neighbours makes up an independent set of atleast
  $\sqrt{n}$ vertices.

  Otherwise, if the maximum degree is $\sqrt{n} -1 \leq \Delta(G)$, we use the
  result from problem 2 section b, to get the following:
  \[
    \sqrt{n} = \frac{n}{(\sqrt{n}-1)+1} \leq \frac{n}{\Delta(G)+1} \leq \alpha(G)
  \]

  An example of a triangle-free graph that does not have an independent set of
  size $\lceil \sqrt{n} \rceil$ (note the ceiling operator, versus the floor
  operator from before), is $C_6$. We can observe that $\alpha(C_6) = 2$, but
  $\lceil \sqrt{6} \rceil = 3$.
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
\item (5 points) Show that a graph is bipartite if and only if it has a subset of vertices which is both an independent set and a vertex cover.
\end{problem}

\section{Bipartite Matching ({\bf max 30})}



\begin{problem}
 \item (5 points) Let $G=(X\cup Y, E)$ be a simple bipartite graph. Suppose that there is 
 a $k \in \NN$ such that $d(x) \ge k \ge d(y)$ for all $x \in X, y \in Y$. Show that $G$ 
 has a matching saturating $X$ (covering all of $X$).
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
 \item (12 points) Let $G=(X\cup Y, E)$ be a simple bipartite graph. Let $A$ be the set of vertices in $G$ of
 maximum degree.
 \begin{subprob}
  \item Show that $G$ has a matching saturating $A \cap X$.
  \item Let $W \subseteq X$ and $Z \subseteq Y$.
  Suppose that there is a matching $M$ that saturates $W$, and a matching $N$ that saturates $Z$.
  Prove that there is a matching that saturates $W \cup Z$.
  \item Conclude that there is a matching that saturates $A$.
 \end{subprob} 
\end{problem}



\begin{problem}
 \item (6 points) Let $G=(X\cup Y, E)$ be a simple bipartite graph such that $d(x) \ge 1$ for all $x \in X$
 and $d(x) \ge d(y)$ for all $\{x,y\} \in E$ ($x \in X, y \in Y$). Show that $G$ has a matching saturating $X$.
\end{problem}


\begin{problem}
 \item (13 points) Let $G=(X\cup Y, E)$ be a simple bipartite graph containing a perfect matching.
 Prove that there is a vertex $x \in X$, such that for every incident edge $\{x,y\}$, there is a perfect matching
  that contains $\{x,y\}$.
\end{problem}



\begin{problem}
 \item (6 points) Let $X,Y$ be disjoint independent sets in a simple graph $G$, such that $|X|=\alpha(G)$. Prove that $G[X\cup Y]$ has a matching of size $|Y|$.
\end{problem}




\section{More Matching ({\bf max 40})}


\begin{problem}
 \item (6 points) Let $G$ be a simple graph with an even number of vertices such that $d(v) \ge \frac{|V(G)|}{2}$ for every  vertex $v \in V(G)$. Show that $G$ has a perfect matching. 
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}
 \item (9 points) Let $T$ be a tree on $n$ vertices with $l$ leaves. Show that $T$ has a matching
 of size at least $\left\lceil \frac{n-l}{2} \right\rceil$.
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  This we can prove by induction on the number of leaves.

  \textbf{Basis step:}
  $l \leq 2$, trivial.
  
  \textbf{Induction step:}
  Let $T$ be a tree with $n$ vertices and $l$ leaves, so that
  \[
    \lceil \frac{n-l}{2} \rceil \leq |M^*|
  \]

  Let's construct a tree $T'$ with $l + 1$ leaves by adding a branch of\
  length $2\alpha + \delta$ to $T$ from a non-leaf vertex, where:
  \[
    \delta =
    \begin{cases}
      0,&\text{if new branch length is even}\\
      1,&\text{if new branch length is odd}
    \end{cases}
  \]

  For $T'$, we have that:
  \[
    \begin{split}
      \lceil \frac{(n + 2\alpha + \delta) - (l + 1)}{2} \rceil =\\
      \lceil \frac{(n - l) + (\delta - 1)}{2} + \alpha \rceil =\\
      \lceil \frac{(n - l) + (\delta - 1)}{2} \rceil + \alpha \leq\\
      |M^*| + \alpha
    \end{split}
  \]
  Which as can be seen holds no matter if $\delta = 0$ or $\delta = 1$.
  
\end{solution}

\begin{problem}
\item (8 points) For every $k \ge 1$, show that every simple $k$-regular graph has a matching of size at least
$\frac{n}{4 - \frac{2}{k}}$.\\ {\small Hint: show that this bound holds for every maximal matching.}
\end{problem}



\begin{problem}
\item (10 points) Let $M$ be a matching and $X$ be a set of vertices in a graph.
Show that, if $X$ is saturated by $M$, then $X$ is also saturated by some maximum matching.
\end{problem}




\begin{problem}
 \item (10 points) Show that a tree has either one perfect matching or none. For a graph $G$, denote by 
 $o(G)$ the number of components of $G$ of odd cardinality. Prove that, for a tree $T$, $T$ has a perfect 
 matching, if and only if, $o(T - v) = 1$ for all vertices $v$.
\end{problem}



\begin{problem}
 \item (13 points) Let  $M$ be a maximal matching and $M^*$ be a maximum matching in a graph $G$.
 \begin{subprob}
 \item Show that $|M|\ge |M^*|/2$.
  \item Show that if there is no $M$-augmenting path of length at least three then $|M| \ge 2|M^*|/3$.
 \end{subprob}
\end{problem}

\begin{solution}
  Let's assume by contradiction that $|M| < |M^*|/2$. At most $2|M|$ edges
  in $M^*$ have a vertex in $M$. Since we have that $2|M| < |M^*|$,
  there is at least one edge in $|M^*|$ that has no vertex in $M$. That
  edge can be added to $M$ to make a larger matching, which leads to a
  contradiction since $M$ wasn't maximal.
  
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}
\end{solution}
